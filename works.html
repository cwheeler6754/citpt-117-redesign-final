                        Katniss is a 16-year-old girl living with her mother and younger sister in the poorest
                        district of Panem, the remains of what used be North America. The terrain, rules, and level
                        of audience participation may change but one thing is
                        constant: kill or be killed. When her sister is chosen by lottery, Katniss steps up to go in
                        her place.(Scholastic Press, 2008)

                        Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. As time draws
                        near for
                        Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are
                        higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in
                        their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.(Scholastic Press, 2009)

                        leaders. A revolution is unfolding. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay - no matter what
                        the cost. (Scholastic Press, 2010)
