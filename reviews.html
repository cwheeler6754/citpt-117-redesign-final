                "The Hunger Games is as close to perfect an adventure novel as I've ever read. I could not put it down.
                Collins has transformed the ancient Labyrinth myth into a terrifyingly believable tale of future
                America. Readers will be hungry for more."

                "Charlie loves computer games so much, he never plays with anything else - so when the power goes out,
                he's really in the dark. His desperate search for batteries involves his sister's toys and some nasty
                behavior before he settles down to realize what's truly important in his life. Deftly written by Suzanne
                Collins and nicely illustrated by Mike Lester, When Charlie McButton Lost Power is refreshingly original
                and moving!"

            <p class="reviewp"><img class="reviewimgleft" src="media/newsday.jpg" alt="newsdaylogo">
                In "Year of the Jungle", Collins writes a child's-eye memoir
                of life during her father's tour in Vietnam. Soldiers who go to war leave questions for families to live
                with -- Where are they? What are they experiencing? Are they alive? -- and children are experts at
                filling in gaps. The little girl hears her father is in the jungle, so she imagines the jungle she knows
                from cartoons. The illustrations show how clues from the adult world feed her worries. She is a thinker,
                and when her father arrives home, changed, she finds a way to reach him."
