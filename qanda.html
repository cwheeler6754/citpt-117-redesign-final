                    <h4>1. Of all the places Gregor could have traveled to, why the Underland?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I liked the fact that this world was teeming under New York City and nobody was aware of it.
                        That you could be going along preoccupied with your own problems and then whoosh! You take a
                        wrong turn in your laundry room and suddenly a giant cockroach is right in your face. No magic,
                        no space or time travel, there's just a ticket to another world behind your clothes dryer. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h4>2. Are you anything like Gregor?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I think I'm like Gregor because we both want to do the right thing but sometimes have trouble
                        figuring out what it is. Also, neither of us likes to ride roller coasters and we've both
                        changed a lot of diapers.
                        But Gregor is much braver than I am…if I even see a regular sized rat in New York City I
                        immediately cross the street. </p>

                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h4>3. Is there anything you find/found difficult or challenging in writing from the perspective of
                        an 11-year-old boy?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I remember being eleven very clearly and I had a lot of friends who were boys so it felt pretty
                        natural being in Gregor's head. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h4>4. What kinds of things did you enjoy doing when you were 11?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Gymnastics, like Luxa. Reading. Running around in the woods with my friends. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h4>5. Many people think bats, rats, cockroaches, and spiders are creepy! Did you have to get over
                        your fear of any (or all!) of them to write this story?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I wish I could say that after I researched the creepy animals I was no longer at all afraid of
                        them…but that would be a big fib!
                    </p>

                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h4>6. Are you kinder to cockroaches, bats, rats, and/or spiders nowadays?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I don't think I was ever particularly unkind to them…but I do have more of a connection with
                        them now. I'm more aware of their similarities to humans. And I'm sympathetic to their desire to
                        survive, which all creatures share. </p>

                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h4>7. Did you have a sibling who, like Boots, got you into a world of trouble?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I have two older sisters and one older brother and hold them largely responsible for the trouble
                        I got into growing up. I believe as the youngest child, that is my right. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h4>8. Have you ever lived in New York City?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I lived in New York City for 16 years, from 1987 to 2003. But when I was growing up we moved all
                        the time because my dad was in the Air Force. We were mostly on the eastern half of the U.S. and
                        in Europe but, like Gregor, I definitely know what it feels like to be a stranger somewhere.

                    <h4>9. Have you ever been lost and wanted to find your way home?</h4>
                    <p>
                        All the time. I have a terrible sense of direction. I get lost practically every time I leave my
                        house. Fortunately, people are usually very kind about giving you directions if you ask
                        politely. </p>

                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h4>10. Do you think you were destined to be a writer? (or is there some free will involved?!)</h4>
                    <p>
                        I…have no idea how to answer this. I would have to go to a cave and meditate on it or something,
                        and then I probably still wouldn't know. </p>
