                        It is the morning of the reaping that will kick off the tenth annual Hunger Games. In the
                        Capitol, eighteen-year-old Coriolanus Snow is preparing for his one shot at glory as a mentor in
                        the Games.The odds are against him. He’s been given the humiliating assignment of mentoring the
                        female tribute from District 12, the lowest of the low. Their fates are now completely
                        intertwined — every choice Coriolanus makes could lead to favor or failure, triumph or ruin.
                        Inside the arena, it will be a fight to the death. Outside the arena, Coriolanus starts to feel
                        for his doomed tribute . . . and must weigh his need to follow the rules against his desire to
                        survive no matter what it takes.

                        read my fantasy series, The Underland Chronicles, you will have a clue as to why I chose this
